Vue Router best practices, common gotchas, and navigation patterns.

### Navigation Guards
- Navigating between same route with different params → See [router-beforeenter-no-param-trigger](references/router-beforeenter-no-param-trigger.md)
- Accessing component instance in beforeRouteEnter guard → See [router-beforerouteenter-no-this](references/router-beforerouteenter-no-this.md)
- Navigation guard making API calls without awaiting → See [router-guard-async-await-pattern](references/router-guard-async-await-pattern.md)
- Users trapped in infinite redirect loops → See [router-navigation-guard-infinite-loop](references/router-navigation-guard-infinite-loop.md)
- Navigation guard using deprecated next() function → See [router-navigation-guard-next-deprecated](references/router-navigation-guard-next-deprecated.md)

### Route Lifecycle
- Stale data when navigating between same route → See [router-param-change-no-lifecycle](references/router-param-change-no-lifecycle.md)
- Event listeners persisting after component unmounts → See [router-simple-routing-cleanup](references/router-simple-routing-cleanup.md)

### Setup
- Building production single-page application → See [router-use-vue-router-for-production](references/router-use-vue-router-for-production.md)
